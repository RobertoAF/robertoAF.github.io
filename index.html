      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        Hi! My name is Roberto. I am originally from Southern California but have intermittently lived in Mexico, Spain, France, Italy, South Korea and Taiwan. I am also a long-term resident of the San Francisco Bay Area, where I currently study computer science and work as a translator.
      </p>

      <p>
        As an undergraduate, I majored in Interdisciplinary Studies at UC Berkeley, with a concentration in Spanish, French and Italian language. As an MA candidate in Computer Science at Mills College, my  interdisciplinary concentration is in linguistics.
      </p>

      <p>
        In short, I am an idea-driven person who is passionate about building things, design and languages. I am currently seeking a position as a software developer in which I can make use of my prior experience in education and translation.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy walking, languages, photography, museums and cooking!
      <p>
