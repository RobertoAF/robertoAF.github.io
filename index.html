    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Roberto. I am originally from Southern California but have intermittently lived in Mexico, Spain, France, Italy, South Korea and Taiwan. I am also a long-term resident of the San Francisco Bay Area, where I currently study computer science and work as a translator.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an undergraduate, I majored in Interdisciplinary Studies at UC Berkeley, with a concentration in Spanish, French and Italian language. As an MA student in Computer Science at Mills College, my interdisciplinary concentration is in linguistics.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, I am an idea-driven person who is passionate about building things, both natural language and programming languages, and design.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy walking, languages, photography, going to museums and cooking.

    <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Machine Learning Research: Automatic Dialect Detection (Master’s Thesis Project): (Python)</b>
        <br>
        Developing a model utilizing supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) to automatically detect regional variants of global, vernacular Spanish. Twitter corpus development includes managing large amounts of textual data from multiple countries. 
	Typical tasks include writing Python scripts to clean and label data using key NLP libraries (NLTK, Stanford CoreNLP) for improved training purposes. Testing and evaluation of various ML algorithms for improved accuracy and performance.

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Switch: (Android/Java, SQLite)</b>
        <br>
        Led a team of four in the design and implementation of an Android computer science dictionary for beginning undergraduate students, including UI, voice recognition capability, adherence to design guidelines and database implementation. Collaborated on general back-end functionality (SQLite database), implemented the user history functionality, and performed key text processing tasks using Python.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>College Requirements Scheduling Application: (Java)</b>
        <br>
        Built a desktop application to help Mills College students determine completed major requirements and provide recommendations on their selection of future courses.
